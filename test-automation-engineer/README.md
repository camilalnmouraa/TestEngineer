# Test Automation Engineer

This test aims to demonstrate your abilities to write and execute a simple testing framework under the GitHub CI/CD runners. The included repository has a single Python file with several functions inside that require basic tests. You can use any framework you are familiar with to write tests for these functions.

- Write tests for each function inside the Python file.
- Push the code and your tests to a GitHub repository, and write a GitHub workflow that should:
  - Execute tests against that image.
  - Bonus points for building a containerized docker image and executing the tests against that image.
